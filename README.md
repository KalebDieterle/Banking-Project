A banking program I have made in order to help me practice python and understand objecct-oriented programming along with working files.

All of the user data is stored within the bankingdata.txt file, of which is loaded once the program is launched

All transaction history is stored within transactionhistory.txt, of which is also loaded once the program is launched.
